# Design-Patterns
Project was a part of the subject called Design Pattern in the winter Semester 2022 at University of Zagreb, Faculty of Organization and Informatics in Vara≈ædin. The class was created to teach us typical solutions to common problems in software design. That each pattern is like a blueprint that we can customize to solve a particular design problem in our code. We also learned all of the benefits of using design patterns.

The program was created as a set of tasks that required to use the learned knowledge of design patterns to identify and implement the correct pattern that helps in solving the given problem. Program was created in Java.
